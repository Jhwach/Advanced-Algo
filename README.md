# Advanced Algorithms Repository

This repository contains various advanced algorithms implemented in C++. To run the C++ code on your system, follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **G++ Compiler**: This is used to compile the C++ code.
- **Git**: This is needed to clone the repository.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal on your system and run the following command to clone the repository:

```
`git clone https://github.com/Jhwach/Advanced-Algo.git`
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your device.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```
`cd Advanced-Algo`
```

### 3. Compile the C++ Code

Use the `g++` compiler to compile any C++ file in the repository. For example, if you have a file `xyz.cpp`, run the following command:

```
`g++ xyz.cpp -o output`
```

This will compile `xyz.cpp` and create an executable file named `output`.

### 4. Run the Compiled Code

Once the compilation is successful, run the executable file using the following command:

```
`./output`
```

This will execute your C++ code, and you should see the output in the terminal.

## Notes

- Replace `xyz.cpp` with the actual file name you want to compile.
- The `-o output` option tells the compiler to create an executable named `output`. You can change `output` to any name you prefer.
- If you encounter any errors related to `g++` not being found, you may need to install the compiler. On most systems, you can install it using the following:

   **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
   ```
   `sudo apt update`
   `sudo apt install g++`
   ```

   **On macOS** (with Homebrew):
   ```
   `brew install gcc`
   ```

   **On Windows** (with MinGW or WSL):
   Follow the relevant installation instructions for your setup.

## Enjoy!

Once the above steps are completed, you're ready to run any other C++ code in this repository or make changes as needed. Happy coding!

This README includes both the instructions for setting up and running the C++ code as well as repository-specific information.
